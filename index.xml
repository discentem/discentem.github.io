      <description>Credits First off, I want to thank my friend Wes Whetstone for giving me feedback on this post before I published it.
He told me I was holding it (Salt) wrong and to stop trying to make Salt act like Chef. He was very respectful in this criticism and he encouraged me to rewrite the code using custom state modules and custom execution modules to make it more proper Salt code.</description>

      <description>Today I had to help a remote user wipe their macOS workstation for a fresh start. Fortunately my team has DEP and MDM set up so we were able to get up and running pretty quickly. Unfortunately, our DEP configuration is still rough around the edges; we don&amp;rsquo;t have NoMAD Login+ yet, so initiating AD auth remotely is complicated as the VPN wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be connected until after a user is logged in.</description>
